The challenge is to build out this calculator app and our users should be able to:

## Sprint I

- Perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

## Sprint II

- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## Sprint III

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size

## Sprint IV

- Enable continuous calculation on the current operation when `=` is pressed over and over
- Enable instant result when an operation is performed without using `=`. (Makes `=` optional)

> May have to rewrite the tests and logic of other methods
